# Authentication

<Callout>
  This authentication is only related to the `/social` endpoints. If you're
  looking for authentication for the `/quotes` endpoint, please see [this
  documentation](/endpoints/authentication).
</Callout>

These endpoints require you to be authenticated. You will need to send an `Authorization` header with your access token along with your request.

## Register

#### POST /api/v1/social/auth/register

This endpoint will register a new user. You will need to send the following body along with the POST request.

```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "avatar": "string",
  "password": "string"
}
```

You can now use your registered account to log in.

## Login

#### POST /api/v1/social/auth/login

You can use this endpoint to login with your registered user. You will need to send the following body along with the POST request.

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "string"
}
```

In return you will receive a response with the following body:

```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "avatar": "string",
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...."
}
```

You can now use this access token as the Bearer token in the `Authorization` header for all `/social` endpoints.

#### Example of sending Authorization header.

```js
const options = {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    Authorization: 'Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9....',
  },
}

const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/v1/quotes`, options)
const data = await response.json()
```
