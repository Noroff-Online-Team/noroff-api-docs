# Authentication

<Callout>
  This authentication is only related to the `/quotes` endpoints.
</Callout>

Some endpoints may require you to be authenticated. This is done by sending an `Authorization` header with your access token along with your request.

## Login

In order to receive an access token you will need to login. You do not need to register an account, you can simply login with any username.

You can login by sending a `POST` request to the `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint with your username in the request body.

#### POST /api/v1/auth/login

```json
{
  "username": "my_username" // Required
}
```

In return you will receive a response with the following body:

```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...."
}
```

You can now use this access token as the Bearer token in the `Authorization` header for all endpoints that require authentication.

#### Example of sending Authorization header.

```js
const options = {
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9....',
  },
}

const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/v1/quotes`, options)
const data = await response.json()
```
