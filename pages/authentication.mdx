# Authentication

**Unless the endpoint specifically mentions that it requires authentication, you can use that endpoint freely without supplying an access token.**

Some endpoints may require you to be authenticated. This is done by sending an `Authorization` header with your access token along with your request.

## Access token

In order to receive an access token you will need to login. You can do this by sending a `POST` request to the `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint with your username in the request body.

##### POST /api/v1/auth/login

```json
{
  "username": "my_username"
}
```

In return you will receive a response with the following body:

```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...."
}
```

You can now use this access token as the Bearer token in the `Authorization` header for all endpoints that require authentication.

```js
// Example of sending Authorization header.
const options = {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    Authorization: 'Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9....',
  },
}

const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/v1/quotes`, options)
const data = await response.json()
```
